# **App Name**: Code Companion

## Core Features:

- Code Generation: Generate code snippets from natural language descriptions for different programming languages. The LLM tool is provided with information about each programming language, and uses reasoning to incorporate relevant examples of syntax, language-specific function names and common code structures.
- Error Explanation: Automatically identify and explain errors in the user's code. The LLM tool uses principles of debugging and testing to respond.
- Language Selection: Multi-language support for code generation, including Java.
- Interface: A clean and intuitive user interface to input prompts and view generated code.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A muted blue (#5DADE2), evokes feelings of trust, security, and intelligence, making users feel confident in the code generated.
- Background color: Dark gray (#34495E) a dark theme to be easier on the eyes during long coding sessions.
- Accent color: A vibrant purple (#9B59B6) is used for buttons and interactive elements, drawing the user's attention to key features without overwhelming the interface.
- A monospaced font to mimic a code editor.
- Simple, outline-style icons.
- Clearly separated panels for input, code generation, and output to reduce clutter and increase usability.
- Keywords (e.g., class, public, static, void, if, else): Often displayed in blue, purple, or bold text.
- Strings (e.g., "Hello, World!"): Typically shown in green or orange.
- Comments (e.g., // This is a comment or /* Multi-line comment */): Usually in gray, italicized, or green.
- Annotations (e.g., @Override, @Deprecated): Highlighted in yellow, orange, or bold.
- Classes and Types (e.g., String, int, List): Often in light blue or cyan.
- Methods (e.g., System.out.println()): Displayed in white, blue, or italicized.
- Variables (e.g., myVariable, counter): Typically in white or default text color.
- Numbers (e.g., 123, 3.14): Highlighted in orange or purple.
- Errors or Warnings: Errors are often underlined in red, while warnings might be underlined in yellow or orange.
